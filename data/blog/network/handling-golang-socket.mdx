## Intro

As an assignment of Network Design Course, I have a chance to handle golang socket programming.
I will introduce golang socket programming in this article. And you could learn how to handle
multi-client supported Server Program & `Go Routine`

## Before Start

This Project should be run on any system with network connection.
And also Server-side program should support multi-client connection.
To support this, we should use `Go Routine` which is light weight thread.

### How go handle Multi-Client using Go Routine?

`Go Routine` is a way to handle multi-thread program. More simply, it could make your program faster(usually).
When new Client try to connect with server,
we create a connection with that Client, and run a function to handle this connection using `Go Routine`.
By using this way, we can have the same effect like `fork` in Clang socket programming.
It means, we can handle the connections separately and effectively.

Here is the example of `Go Routine`

```go

...

func showGoRoutine(idx int) {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	fmt.Println("idx :", idx, " showGoRoutine")
}

func main() {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		go showGoRoutine(i)
	}
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
}


// print(order of print differs every runtime)
// idx : 3  showGoRoutine
// idx : 2  showGoRoutine
// idx : 1  showGoRoutine
// idx : 0  showGoRoutine
// idx : 4  showGoRoutine

```

## Server Program

Handling server program is very simple.
Create a Listener to be notified when a new client is connected.
When we get a new connection from client, we accept the connection.
Then read the data from client and write the data to client.

### Handling Single-Client Connection

But the problem is, we close socket right after we got the data from client.
So, we feels like it support multi-client connection.
But it doesn't keep the connection, which means meaningless.
To support multi-client in genuine way, we should use `Go Routine`

```go
func main() {
	listener, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":"+serverPort)
	buffer := make([]byte, 1024)

	for {
		conn, _ := listener.Accept()
		count, _ := conn.Read(buffer)
		conn.Write(bytes.ToUpper(buffer[:count]))
		conn.Close()
	}
}
```

### Handling Multi-Client Connection

```go
func main() {
	conn, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":12000")
	defer conn.Close()

	for {
		conn, err := conn.Accept()
    // run a function for every new connection(using Go Routine)
		go handleConnection(conn)
	}
}

func handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
	buffer := make([]byte, 1024)
	for {
    n, err := conn.Read(buffer)
    data := buffer[:n]
  	_, err := conn.Write([]byte(strings.ToUpper(data)))
	}
}

```

## Client Program

Handling client program is very simple.
Create a socket and connect to server. Then get user input and send to server.
When we get the response from server, we print it.

### One-time data transfer

One-time data transfer means we close the connection after we send the data.
To keep the connection(we are using TCP protocol) & support Multi-time data transfer,
we will separate data transfer and data receiving code using `Go Routine`.

```go
func main() {
	conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", serverName+":"+serverPort)
	defer conn.Close()

	fmt.Printf("Input lowercase sentence: ")
	input, _ := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin).ReadString('\n')
	// Send data which is received from user
	conn.Write([]byte(input))

	buffer := make([]byte, 1024)
	// Wait for response from server
	conn.Read(buffer)
	fmt.Printf("Reply from server: %s", string(buffer))
}

```

### Multi-time data transfer

```go
func main(){
  conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", serverName+":"+serverPort)
	defer conn.Close()

  // To prevent user-input while waitiing response from server
  isWaitingResponse := false

  // Data Receiving Code(Go Routine)
  // Keep waiting for response from server
	go func() {
		data := make([]byte, 1024)

		for {
			n, err := conn.Read(data)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("Server is closed")
				os.Exit(1)
			}

			fmt.Println("Server send : " + string(data[:n]))
      // Release flag to receive user-input
			isWaitingResponse = false
		}
	}()

  for {
		if !isWaitingResponse {
      fmt.Printf("Input sentence: ")
      input, _ := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin).ReadString('\n')
      conn.Write([]byte(input))
      // Set flag to prevent user-input while waiting response from server
      isWaitingResponse = true
		}
	}
}
```

## Graceful Shutdown

Graceful Shutdown means we close the connection for both client & server in normal way.
To reach this, when we got interrupt from user or EOF from Client or Error from Write & Read process,
terminate the Go routine function using `break` or shutdown the Server/Client program using `os.Exit(1)`.
We are using TCP protocol, so Server/Client program should know the status of Client/Server connection.
Then Server/Client program should also be shutdown the connection(For Client program, should be terminated).

## Conclusion

> For Clang, you can support multi-client connection by using fork.

> For OOP languages, you can support multi-client connection by Multi-Thread Programming.

The traditional way we handle multi-client connection in Clang & OOP languages is very diffult.
But by using Go Routine, which is very well abstracted and easy to use, we can support multi-client connection very very easy.
