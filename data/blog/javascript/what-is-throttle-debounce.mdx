## Intro

Today I will share the basics of throttle & debounce function.

## Concepts & Definitions

Throttle and Debounce are two functions that are used to throttle and debounce the execution of a function.
The both functions are used to prevent the function from being executed too often.
Their concept is similar but different from guaranteeing that a function will be executed at most once.

### Throttle

Throttle is a function that `Guarantees execution of callback function in "n" milliseconds`.
It is used when we want to execute a function only after a certain amount of time has passed.
For example, Web Browser fires the `scroll` event every time the user scrolls the page.
We can use throttle to prevent the `scroll` event from being fired too often. By this we can
get the improved performance of the browser.

To implement this we need to use the `setTimeout` function.

```jsx:throttle.js
function throttle(callback, delay){
  // it is possible because js supports closures
  let timer;

  return function(){
    // if there is a timer, reject new event
    if(!timer){
      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        timer = null;
        callback.apply(this, arguments);
      }, delay)
    }
  }
```

At this point, we need to know what `closure` is. `closure` is a property that programming language supports
for the purpose of keeping the state of the function. By definition, `closure` is an ability
to memorize the execution context of declared `lexical scope` when the function is created and to use it when the function is called.
To sum up, `closure` is an ability to use the function like an Object(we call it `first class function`)

So we can save timer variable in throttle function and check if there is a timer that is running or not.
If there is a timer, we reject the new event. If there is no timer, we set the new timer and execute callback when the timer ends.
When the timer is done, we set the timer to null.

### Debounce

Debounce is a function that `Execute the callback function only for the last event that exceeds a certain amount of time among consecutive events`. So even if the client fires the event multiple times,
and the events are fired faster than the delay, the callback function will only be executed once.
It is commonly used when we want to optimize the performance of showing results of a search.
(For example, if the user types in the search box, the results are shown after the user stops typing for a certain amount of time.
It reduces the number of requests to the server.)

To implement this we need to use the `clearTimeout and setTimeout` function.

```jsx:debounce.js
function debounce(callback, delay){
  let timer;

  return function(){
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      callback.apply(this, arguments);
    }, delay)
  }
}
```

If new event is fired before the timer is done, we clear(or reset) the current timer and set the new timer.
If the timer is done, we execute the callback function. By doing this, we can call the last event that exceeds the delay
which leads to performance improvement.

But Debounce function has a disadvantage. If you want to execute the callback function which needs to guarantee the execution,
It is not a good idea to use this. Because the Debounced function will not execute until the input is stopped.
To prevent this, we can use the `throttle` function instead.

## Conclusion

Feel the difference between throttle and debounce function.
