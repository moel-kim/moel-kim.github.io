## Intro

On January 2022,
my college senior [pula39](https://github.com/pula39) suggest me
to make advent calendar together. At that time I didn't understand
what is it and the concept it has. To sum up, it is like a time casule
that we write something on it and reveal it on specific point of time.

When I got the idea of it, I directly said I'm ok to join the project.
And I am familiar with Front-End, so I joined as FE.

So this post is for summarizing what I have learned from dealing with
Calendar and Modal Components which is very important for FE Developers.
I hope this post is helpful for you dev.

## Calendar Component Options

If you are using React and also looking for calendar component. We have 3 options you can easily import to your project.

![React-Dates](/static/images/proj/advent/react-dates.gif)

1. [React-Dates](https://github.com/react-dates/react-dates)

- Pros
  - Maintained by Airbnb Corp.
  - Have many documents to reference
  - Not too hard to customizing style
  - Show how to use this library by [storybook](https://react-dates.github.io/react-dates/?path=/story/daterangepicker-drp--default)
- Cons
  - React-Dates made with javascript(using prop-types, not typescript)
  - Using Momentjs(Still fameous but deprecated, Mutable Type)

![TUI-calendar](/static/images/proj/advent/toast-ui-calendar.png)

2. [TUI-calendar](https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar)

- Pros
  - Beautiful

`For Customizing & Considering Launching Plan, I choose to use React-Dates`

## How to handle React-Dates

Before read this section I hope you know what is [Advent Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar)

### React-Dates Props

React-Dates have many types of Calendar.
But for Zeropage Advent Calendar Project,
I choose [DayPicker style](https://react-dates.github.io/react-dates/?path=/story/daypicker--default) & using [DayPickerSingleDateController](https://react-dates.github.io/react-dates/?path=/story/daypickersingledatecontroller--default) component for customizing.

```jsx:Calendar.tsx
return (
  <DayPickerSingleDateController
    {...props}
    initialVisibleMonth={() => moment('2022-02-01')}
    isOutsideRange={(day) =>
      !isInclusivelyAfterDay(day, moment(process.env.REACT_APP_CALENDAR_START_DATE)) ||
      !isInclusivelyBeforeDay(day, moment(process.env.REACT_APP_CALENDAR_END_DATE))
    }
    transitionDuration={300}
    daySize={DaySizeMemo}
    numberOfMonths={1}
    hideKeyboardShortcutsPanel
    focused={Inputs.focused}
    date={Inputs.date}
    isDayHighlighted={(day1) =>
      Array.from(calendarItems.keys()).some((day2) => isSameDay(day1, moment(day2)))
    }
    onDateChange={handleDateChange}
    onFocusChange={handleFocusChange}
    renderDayContents={renderDayContents}
    renderWeekHeaderElement={renderWeekHeaderElement}
    renderCalendarInfo={renderCalendarInfo}
  />
)
```

React-Dates named props & callback functions well. But for comprehension, I will explain important props

- isOutSideRange(callback)
  - It restrict the dates you can choose
  - day value is callback factor & if true is returned, that day is disabled and can't choose
- transitionDuration
  - When you move to another month, react-dates give transition animation. It defines the transition time of animation
- `daySize`
  - react-dates using transition animation, So react-dates doesn't support changing width & height of day scell using css. It should be modified by daySize props.
  - I use useMemo Hooks for caching daycell size changing between mobile and desktop size
- `isDayHighlighted(callback)`
  - It shows which daycell is highlighted.
  - This is key prop for showing which daycell is already taken by user.
  - day value is callback factor & it true is returned, that day is highlighted
- `renderDayContents(callback)`
  - This prop make customizing each daycell possible
  - it defines daycell rendering style
- renderCalendarInfo(callback)
  - Render Caution or user defined content below daycell block

### Core Props for implementation

For implementing advent calendar, the core props were daySize, isDayHighlighted, renderDayContents

Because the part that make this project diffult is abstruse css property of react-dates,
uncustomizable daycell size by css,
reducing searching cost when renderDayContents callback called and search proper data that day has

#### Let's see how renderDayContents works

![renderDayContents](/static/images/proj/advent/advent-modifiers.gif)

When daycell is on rendering process, react-dates call renderDayContents function every time for each daycell.
It throws information about day, modifiers. Day is for the day react-dates want to render, modifiers is for
the information about that day. Its ADT is Set(), it could contains 'valid', 'hovered', 'blocked', 'blocked-out-of-range' , 'highlighted-calendar', 'first-day-of-week'

```jsx:Calendar.tsx
const renderDayContents = useCallback(
  (day: moment.Moment, modifiers: ModifiersShape) => {
    if (!isInit) return <div>If data not received, reder nothing</div>
    // Search calendarItem using date as key
    const result = calendarItems.get(day.format('YYYY-MM-DD'))
    if (!result)
      return <>{modifiers.has('valid') && <div>Define style for valid date but not taken</div>}</>
    return (
      <>
        {modifiers.has('highlighted-calendar') && (
          <div>Define style for valikd and taken daycell</div>
        )}
      </>
    )
  },
  [calendarItems, isInit]
)
```

So using conditional rendering, we separate to three daycell designs.

1. If data fetching failed or not initialized, show default daycell Design
2. If nobody took the daycell, show + button
3. If someone took the daycell, show profile image & username

If you don't know the role of modifiers, I thought this part could be diffult.

#### Data Processing

If I want to show proper data by each cell, we should search the data from Array.
The simplest way to implement this is like below

```jsx:Calendar.tsx
const renderDayContents = useCallback(
  (day: moment.Moment, modifiers: ModifiersShape) => {
    {...}
    const result = calendarItems.find((calendarItem) => isSameDay(day, moment(calendarItem.openDate))
    {...}
  },
  [calendarItems, isInit]
)
```

But if we just search item without data processing, it takes too long.
And renderDayContents is executed on every day cells. So the cost is over O(n^2).
I decided to use HashMap ADT. Implemented like below.

```jsx
	const getCalendarItemsData = useCallback(async () => {
		const data = await getAllCalendars();
		let mapObj = new Map<string, IAdventCalendarItem>();
		for (const key in data) {
			const newKey = moment(data[Number(key)].openDate).format("YYYY-MM-DD");
			mapObj.set(newKey, data[Number(key)]);
		}
		setCalendarsItems(mapObj);
		setInit(true);
	}, []);
```

Date with format YYYY-MM-DD is set as key of hashmap. So it becomes much faster

## Applying Modal System

For better performance and easy usability, apply createPortal & useContext Hook
for showing modal on DOM

### ModalContext

we created ModalContext.tsx and define states in the file.

```jsx:ModalStore.tsx
export const useModal = (): IModalContext => useContext(ModalContext);

export const ModalProvider: FC = ({ children }) => {
	const [modal, setModal] = {...};
	const [modalOption, setModalOption] = {...};
	const closeModal = {...}
	const openModal = {...}
	const openLoginModal = {...}
	const openCalendarInfoModal = {...}
	const openCalendarCreateModal = {...}
	return (
		<ModalContext.Provider
			value={{
				...
			}}
		>
			{children}
		</ModalContext.Provider>
	);
};
```

Each modal and modalOption have state which modal is opened for now and data that modal needs

```jsx:ModalContainer.tsx
const ModalContainer: FC = () => {
    const {modal, modalOption, closeModal} = useModal();

    const SelectRenderingModal: { [keys in TModal]: JSX.Element } = {
        "CALENDAR-INFO": <CalendarInfoModal onClose={closeModal} options={modalOption}/>,
        "CALENDAR-CREATE": <CalendarCreateModal onClose={closeModal} options={modalOption}/>,
    };

    return (
        <ModalPortal>
            <ModalBase onClose={closeModal} show={!!modal}>
                {modal ? SelectRenderingModal[modal] : null}
            </ModalBase>
        </ModalPortal>
    );
};
```

In ModalContainer Component, import the state of modal and modalOption.
If the modal state is changed, ModalContainer shows the proper Modal Component(We defined CalendarCreate, CalendarInfo Modal)

So this is how front-end of this project implemented

## Summary

It is really good project to know how calendar component works.
