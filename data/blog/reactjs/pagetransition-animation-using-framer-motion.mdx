## Intro

To deliver a smooth transition between pages, we need css animations.
But by using [framer-motion](https://framer.com/motion/) library,
we can easily create a custom animation.
Today I will show you how to apply PageTransition animation using framer-motion.
And plus, explain how to apply SVG Animation which is applied to dark mode switch on this site.

## Framer-motion

![framer-motion-02](https://d.pr/i/fL43wt.gif)

framer-motion is a library that helps you to create custom animations.
The way to use it is very simple(way better than declare css code on your own).
It declares animation code based on a variable unit and then you can share the code with components.

### How to use framer-motion

```jsx:rectangle.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
...
return (
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{
    opacity: 1,
  }}
/>
);
```

when you want to use framer-motion, you need to import motion from 'framer-motion'.
Then, attach `motion.` to html tags. (ex. `<motion.div />`)
And then, you can use framer-motion's animation code.

Every framer html tag has `initial` and `animate` properties.
`initial` is the initial state of the animation. (ex. `initial={{ opacity: 0 }}`)
`animate` is the animation code. (ex. `animate={{ opacity: 1 }}`)
When the component is mounted on React Rendering Tree,
it will start the animation from initial to animate.
So above code will make the opacity of the component 0 to 1 smoothly.

## Apply Page Transition Globally

So how we apply PageTransition animation globally?
First we need to make a component that will be used as a wrapper for all pages.
I define PageTransition Component as below.

```jsx:page-transition.tsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
import React, { FC } from 'react'

const variants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -200, y: 0 },
  enter: { opacity: 1, x: 0, y: 0 },
  exit: { opacity: 0, x: 0, y: -200 },
}

const Transition: FC = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      variants={variants}
      initial="hidden"
      animate="enter"
      exit="exit"
      transition={{ type: 'linear' }}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  )
}

export default Transition
```

framer-motion support animation code that is defined in a variable.
I defined variants for Transition Animation, and then I use `variants` property to set the animation code.
And also I use `initial` and `animate` property to set the initial and animate state of the animation.

At this moment, you can't understand what `exit` property is.
`exit` property is the animation code that will be applied when the component is removed from React Rendering Tree.
But without `AnimatePresence` component, `exit` property is not available.
Because React cannot know when the component is removed from React Rendering Tree.
So Before use `exit` property, you need to wrap the component with `AnimatePresence`.

In this case, I use `AnimatePresence` component at \_app.tsx
which is the entry point of this site(using Next.js)
By doing this, I can use `exit` property and React can detect when the component is removed from React Rendering Tree.

> Warning : you should give key props to Component(If you are using React, `<Switch />`) that is wrapped with `AnimatePresence`.
> Because without unique key props React cannot detect when the component is removed from React Rendering Tree.

```jsx:_app.tsx
export default function App({ Component, pageProps, router }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      ...
      <LayoutWrapper>
        <AnimatePresence>
          <Component {...pageProps} key={router.route}/>
        </AnimatePresence>
      </LayoutWrapper>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

And then, wrap PageTransition Component to all pages you created.
like below.

```jsx:index.tsx
export default function Home({ posts }: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {
  return (
    <Transition>
      ...
    </Transition>
  )
}
```

The reason why we don't wrap PageTransition Component on \_app.tsx is
framer-motion draw animation when the component is mounted on React Rendering Tree.
If we wrap PageTransition Component on \_app.tsx, PageTransition Component will be always mounted
even if the page changed. So, we should not wrap PageTransition Component on \_app.tsx.

## Apply SVG Animation

![site-header](https://d.pr/i/9e47j0.gif)

There is theme switcher on this website-header.
When you enter this website, it transite -90deg to 0deg.
When you click theme switcher, original image will be disappeared
and new them switch image transite -90deg to 0deg.
How we can make this animation? It is simple if you know how to use framer-motion.

```jsx:ThemeSwitch.tsx
const ThemeSwitch = () => {

  ...

  return (
    <button onClick={...}>
      {mounted && (theme === 'dark' || resolvedTheme === 'dark') ? (
        <WeatherSVG>
          <path {`sun-flower vector path`}/>
        </WeatherSVG>
      ) : (
        <WeatherSVG>
          <path {`moon vector path`} />
        </WeatherSVG>
      )}
    </button>
  )
}

export default ThemeSwitch
```

First, if the theme is dark, show sunflower vector image.
If not, show moon vector image.

Then, define WeatherSVG Component to show the vector image with animation.

```jsx:ThemeSwitch.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

const svgVariants: Variants = {
  hidden: { rotate: -90, opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    rotate: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { duration: 1 },
  },
}

const ThemeSwitch = () => {

  const WeatherSVG = useCallback(
    ({ children }) => {
      return (
        <motion.svg
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
          viewBox="0 0 20 20"
          fill="currentColor"
          className="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100"
          variants={svgVariants}
          initial="hidden"
          animate="visible"
          whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
        >
          {children}
        </motion.svg>
      )
    },
    [theme]
  )

  return (
    <button onClick={...}>
      ...
    </button>
  )
}

export default ThemeSwitch
```

WeatherSVG Component should be defined under useCallback hook.
Because our animation should be conducted when the component is mounted.
And then, when user click theme switch button, the animation should be conducted too.

After user enter our website, transition animation should be run once.
Even user change the router to another page, transition animation should not be run.
To resolve this, we use `useCallback` hook. `useCallback` hook caches the function.
The function wrapped with useCallback hook re-make function when the deps of useCallback changed.
By doing this, WeatherSVG component cached when user enter website and do not re-make WeatherSVG Component when user change router.
Finally, we can make the transition animation run only when the component is mounted and user click theme switch button.

## Concolusion

[Toss](https://toss.im/) team is using framer-motion to make animation.
The reason why toss application has smooth animation even if it is webview,
they are using proper web animation library which is framer-motion.
If you can use it well, not only make your web application smooth, it also increases user experience.
