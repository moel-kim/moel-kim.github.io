## Intro

While studying React, I want to implement a new lazy loadable image component.
I usually run a project with Next.js. Next.js provides NextImage as a default image component.
It supports not only lazy loading and also reflow prevention. But in React, there is no such feature.
So I decided to implement my own image component that supports these properties.
In this article, I will share the experience while making this.

## Why we need new Image component?

Normal html image tag has a lot of problem. `First`, it is not responsive.
We need to add 'max-width' to make it responsive. `Second`, it loads all images in DOM.
Imagine a situation where the website has a lot of images, and it takes 10 or more seconds
to load all the images. The user will see a lot of blank spaces in the screen.
`Third`, it is not reflow prevention. If the user does not provide a width and height,
the browser will recalculate the width and height of the image right after the image is loaded.
It leads to a wrong layout which is a.k.a. `Cumulative Layout Shift` problem.

## How to implement new Image component?

Actually NextImage already solved all these problems.Even supports CDN(Content Delivery Network) optimized image delivery.
If you want to use NextImage, learn Next.js and use it.

But I want to implement my own image component.

## Properties of new Image component

These are features of new Image component.

1. Load when Browser Intersects Viewport
2. Support reflow prevention(actually buggy)
3. Support Responsive Attribute

I want to support CDN optimized image delivery. But I don't know how to do it.
If you know(using Akamai, Cloudflare, etc.), please let me know.

### 1. Load when Browser Intersects Viewport

The way to implement this is using Intersection Observer API.
When the component is mounted in react rendering tree,
the browser will start observing the Image element.
When the Image element intersect with viewport, the browser will execute the callback function.
In this case, we set the isLoad variable to true.
Then the image will start loading. The advantage of this is that the image will be loaded
when the user see it. So it leads to lower network usage when it first appears.

```jsx:MyCustomImage.tsx
const Image: FC<ImageWrapperProps> = ({
  src,
  width,
  height,
  alt,
  className,
}) => {
  const imgRef = useRef<HTMLImageElement>(null);
  const observerRef = useRef<IntersectionObserver>();
  const [isLoad, setIsLoad] = useState(false);

  function onIntersection(
    entries: IntersectionObserverEntry[],
    io: IntersectionObserver,
  ) {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        io.unobserve(entry.target);
        setIsLoad(true);
      }
    });
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!observerRef.current) {
      observerRef.current = new IntersectionObserver(onIntersection);
    }
    imgRef.current && observerRef.current?.observe(imgRef.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <img
      ref={imgRef}
      width={width}
      height={height}
      src={isLoad ? src : undefined}
      alt={alt}
    />
  );
};
```

Now the Image component supports loading when the user sees it.
But it still has a problem. Reflow is happening.
As you can see above, browser recalculates the width and height of the image right after the image is loaded.
It makes the performance of the website slow & cause wrong layout. We can solve this problem
by adding custom `placeHolder` image which is shown before the image is loaded.

### 2. Support reflow prevention(actually buggy)

To solve this problem, we can add a placeHolder image when it is not loaded.
Image component should be given the width and height of the image.
So use this props, we show the svg placeholder image.

```jsx:MyCustomImage.tsx

export const placeholderSrc = (width: number, height: number) =>
  `data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 ${width} ${height}"%3E%3C/svg%3E`;

const Image: FC<ImageWrapperProps> = ({
  src,
  width,
  height,
  alt,
  className,
}) => {
  ...same as above

  return (
    <img
      ref={imgRef}
      width={width}
      height={height}
      src={isLoad ? src : placeholderSrc(width, height)}
      alt={alt}
    />
  );
};

```

So when the image is not loaded, browser already knows the actual width and height of the image.
So it will not recalculate the width and height of the image.(But actually, it differs by CSS Property...)

### 3. Support Responsive Attribute

NextImage provides "responsive" | "fixed" | "fill" | "intrinsic" attribute.
We will implement "responsive" and "fill" attribute.
For "responsive", the height of the image will be calculated by the width of the image.
So, set max of the width is 100% of the parent element & the height is auto.
Then the height is decreased and increased by the width of the parent element.
For "fill", the image will be filled the whole parent container.
Both width and height are 100% of the parent element. But the image will be cropped.
So we need to give objectFit property to the image so user can see the image correctly.

```jsx:MyCustomImage.tsx

const Image: FC<ImageWrapperProps> = ({
  src,
  width,
  height,
  alt,
  layout = 'responsive',
  objectFit = 'cover',
  className,
}) => {
  ...same as above

  return (
    <img
      className={cx(
        'bg-none outline-none',
        layout === 'fill' ? 'w-full h-full' : 'max-w-full h-auto',
        objectFit === 'contain' ? 'object-contain' : 'object-cover',
        className,
      )}
      ref={imgRef}
      width={width}
      height={height}
      src={isLoad ? src : placeholderSrc(width, height)}
      alt={alt}
    />
  );
};

```

#### 4. Full Code

```jsx:MyCustomImage.tsx
import { FC, useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import cx from 'classnames';

export const placeholderSrc = (width: number, height: number) =>
  `data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 ${width} ${height}"%3E%3C/svg%3E`;


export type ImageWrapperProps = {
  src: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  alt?: string;
  layout?: 'fill' | 'responsive';
  objectFit?: 'contain' | 'cover';
  className?: string;
};

const Image: FC<ImageWrapperProps> = ({
  src,
  width,
  height,
  alt,
  layout = 'responsive',
  objectFit = 'cover',
  className,
}) => {
  const imgRef = useRef<HTMLImageElement>(null);
  const observerRef = useRef<IntersectionObserver>();
  const [isLoad, setIsLoad] = useState(false);

  function onIntersection(
    entries: IntersectionObserverEntry[],
    io: IntersectionObserver,
  ) {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        io.unobserve(entry.target);
        setIsLoad(true);
      }
    });
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!observerRef.current) {
      observerRef.current = new IntersectionObserver(onIntersection);
    }
    imgRef.current && observerRef.current?.observe(imgRef.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <img
      className={cx(
        'bg-none outline-none',
        layout === 'fill' ? 'w-full h-full' : 'max-w-full h-auto',
        objectFit === 'contain' ? 'object-contain' : 'object-cover',
        className,
      )}
      ref={imgRef}
      width={width}
      height={height}
      src={isLoad ? src : placeholderSrc(width, height)}
      alt={alt}
    />
  );
};
export default Image;

```

## Conclusion

1. Browser Intersection Observer API is a great tool to optimize the performance of the website.
   But too much use of it can cause the performance of the website slow.
   So we need to use it carefully.

2. SVG could be a good choice to use as a placeholder image.

3. Production ready image component need to have more optimizing features.
